# Prerequisites

- Real Numbers and Vector Spaces ($\boldsymbol{R, R ^ 2, R ^ 3,..., R ^ n}$)
- Norms and Distance measures
  - Norms measure the "length" or magnitude of a single vector.
    - A function that assigns a non-negative "size" or "length" to a vector
    - A norm of a vector is zero only if the vector itself is the zero vector, and it is always non-negative.
    - L1 Norm (Manhattan distance): The sum of the absolute values of the vector's components. It's the distance a taxi would travel in a grid-like city.
    - L2 Norm (Euclidean distance): The square root of the sum of the squared values of the vector's components. This is the standard "straight-line" distance 
  - Distance measures quantify how far apart two vectors are from each other.
