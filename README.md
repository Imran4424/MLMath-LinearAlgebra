- Real Numbers and Vector Spaces ($\boldsymbol{R, R ^ 2, R ^ 3,..., R ^ n}$)
- Norms and Distance measures
  - Norms measure the "length" or magnitude of a single vector.
    - A function that assigns a non-negative "size" or "length" to a vector
    - A norm of a vector is zero only if the vector itself is the zero vector, and it is always non-negative.
    - L1 Norm (Manhattan distance): The sum of the absolute values of the vector's components. It's the distance a taxi would travel in a grid-like city.
    - L2 Norm (Euclidean distance): The square root of the sum of the squared values of the vector's components. This is the standard "straight-line" distance 
  - Distance measures quantify how far apart two vectors are from each other.
    - A function that quantifies the separation between two vectors or points
    - The distance between two vectors is zero only if the vectors are identical, it is symmetric $(d(x,y)=d(y,x))$, and it satisfies the triangle inequality (the distance between two points is no more than the sum of the distances from those points to a third point).
    - Manhattan Distance: The L1 norm of the difference between two vectors, representing the distance traveled along axes, like city blocks.
    - Euclidean Distance: The L2 norm of the difference between two vectors, representing the shortest straight-line distance between them.
    - Cosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, often used for high-dimensional, sparse data like text. A cosine similarity of 1 means the vectors point in the same direction.
    - Haversine Distance: Specifically used for navigation on a sphere, it measures the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes.
- The cartesian
